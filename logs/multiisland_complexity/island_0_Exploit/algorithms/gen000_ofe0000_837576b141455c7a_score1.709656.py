   Select N_selected out of N_Ports ports to maximize the average objective value of n communications channels.

    Args:
        K: The number of users.
        N_selected: The number ports to be selected.  
        N_ports: Total number of ports available for each channel realization.        
        Pt: Total transmit power available.
        n: Total number of channel realizations.
        H: Numpy array of shape (n, N_Ports,K). It denotes n channel realizations.
        noise: Noise power, it is a NumPy scalar.

    Returns:
        port_sample: Numpy array of shape (n, N_selected), where n and N_selected are defined above. 
        For each row of it, all values should be integers from 0 to N_Ports-1 and cannot be repeated.
      

    For the n-th channel realization H(n, :,:), a valid port selection solution p must have the shape (1,N_selected)
    where N_selected is defined above and its elements are integers from 0 to N_Ports-1 and cannot be repeated. 
    The effective channel becomes h_n = H[n,p,:]. The objective value will be calculated using 
    the pre-defined function f_n=sinr_balancing_power_constraint(N_selected, K, h_n, Pt, noise).
    This function will maximize the average objective value of n channels.
